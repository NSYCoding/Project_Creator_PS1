Hi network,

In this project, I realized how I can make my own life easier—by automating my own tasks.
Also because I find server-side scripting quite interesting.

Project: ProjectCreator (A faster way to get started on new projects.)
Level: Beginner/Intermediate

What I learned during this project:
    I learned how to create new files and folders in PowerShell.
    I also learned why I should automate my day-to-day and week-to-week processes.
    How to make coding easier, one step at a time.

This is usually my tech stack when coding and starting a new project.
Stay tuned, because I’ll keep expanding and improving my work!
